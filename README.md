INTRODUCTION
In this project, we focus on the analysis of customer churn data from SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications provider. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their services, and understanding the factors behind churn is critical for telecom companies like SyriaTel. By predicting churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize resources.

The SyriaTel Customer Churn dataset contains information about the usage, demographic, and service-related details of customers. The main objective of this project is to identify the key factors influencing customer churn and to build a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of customer attrition.
